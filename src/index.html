                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    Ingala was born in Prospect, Connecticut to Italian parents. 
                    At age four, he started playing the drums when his parents 
                    bought him a drum set; as he got older he learned to play the guitar
                    (he took lessons for about 9 months) and later the saxophone. 
                    As a teenager, he played at local restaurants and clubs. 
                    His father was a disc jockey, and so Vincent was introduced 
                    to many different styles of music, including music from the 1950s 
                    and also smooth jazz.

                    One of the fastest emerging contemporary jazz recording artists in recent 
                    history, multi-instrumentalist, composer and producer, Vincent Ingala 
                    has blasted into an exciting stratosphere of his own making since his 2010 
                    critically acclaimed debut album, ‘North End Soul.’ Still in his twenties, 
                    the charismatic saxophonist has been named Billboard Smooth Jazz Artist 
                    of the Year in 2012, Sirius XM Watercolors Breakthrough Artist of the Year 
                    in 2013, and his music is consistently found atop the most noteworthy music 
                    charts in the world, including four number one hits on the Billboard
                    Smooth Jazz Chart, and eleven singles in the Billboard Smooth Jazz Top 10.

                    His latest effort and sixth studio album, 2020’s ‘Echoes of the Heart,’ 
                    finds Vincent playing almost every instrument throughout the entire album, 
                    along with eight original compositions, and featuring special guest artists, 
                    David Benoit, Steve Oliver and Chris Geith. "Echoes of the Heart" 
                    is the breath of fresh air that long time smooth jazz fans have been craving. 
                    Indeed, it is arguably Vincent’s most complete album to date and affirms 
                    the meteoric progress he has made since 2010. This coast-to-coast sensation 
                    continues to bring a playful spirit, old soul, and youthful enthusiasm 
                    to contemporary jazz, with a real sense for what music fans are seeking, 
                    from recordings to live performances.
