                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    Ingala was born in Prospect, Connecticut to Italian parents. 
                    At age four, he started playing the drums when his parents 
                    bought him a drum set; as he got older he learned to play the guitar
                    (he took lessons for about 9 months) and later the saxophone. 
                    As a teenager, he played at local restaurants and clubs. 
                    His father was a disc jockey, and so Vincent was introduced 
                    to many different styles of music, including music from the 1950s 
                    and also smooth jazz.
